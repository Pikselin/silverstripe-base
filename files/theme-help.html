<p>In this context, you have the ability to define a global theme for the entire website, which will take precedence over any theme that is hardcoded into the website's configuration. The global theme can be set at a central location to ensure consistency across the site.</p>
<p>However, it's important to note that you also have the option to override the global theme on a page-by-page basis. Each page has a "Theme" tab where you can specify a different theme for that specific page. If you choose to set a theme on a particular page, its child pages will inherit the same theme unless they have their own individual theme specified.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a page structure like this:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Root Page
        <ul>
            <li>About Us
                <ul>
                    <li>My Page</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>If you set a theme on the "About Us" page, the "My Page" under it will automatically use the same theme. But if you later decide to set a different theme for "My Page," it will override the inherited theme from "About Us."</p>
<p>In summary, you have the flexibility to set a global theme for the entire site, and at the same time, you can fine-tune the theme on specific pages using the "Theme" tab. Page-level themes are inherited from parent pages unless individually specified.</p>
